The Challenge
Build a solution that behaves like an Autonomous Senior Consultant—a digital entity that doesn't just execute tasks, but reasons about them, understands business context, and delivers production-quality solutions.
Your team will choose the theme below. The theme represents a real consulting engagement that BearingPoint tackles for enterprise clients.
Theme: Green Code Optimizer 🌱
Persona: The "Brain" (Architects & Consultants)
Difficulty: Medium
The Business Problem:
A cloud-native company spends €2M/year on AWS compute. With sustainability goals and rising costs, they need to optimize code for energy efficiency.
Your Mission:
Build an AI system that analyzes code for energy efficiency and suggests "green" refactorings.
Core Requirements:
Energy Profiler: 
Analyze code for energy-intensive patterns: 
Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) where O(n log n) possible)
Excessive memory allocations
Unnecessary network calls
Polling instead of event-driven patterns
Estimate energy consumption (CPU cycles, memory pressure)
AI Optimization Engine: 
Suggest refactorings to reduce energy footprint
Generate optimized code snippets
Calculate estimated savings (kWh, €, CO₂)
Impact Dashboard: 
Show energy consumption by module/service
Track optimization impact over time
Gamification (sustainability score, team rankings)
Deliverables:
Working analyzer for at least 2 energy anti-patterns
Before/after energy comparison for demo refactorings
Dashboard showing sustainability metrics
ROI calculator (energy savings → cost savings → CO₂ reduction)
Bonus Points:
Integration with cloud cost APIs (AWS Cost Explorer)
Right-sizing recommendations (smaller VM instances)
Database query optimization for energy efficiency
Tech Suggestions:
Profiling: .NET Diagnostic Tools, Java Flight Recorder
Analysis: Any static analysis framework + LLM
Carbon metrics: Green Software Foundation APIs
Sourcing Your Data: Use the Green Software Foundation’s Public APIs for carbon intensity data. For code, use standard algorithmic benchmarks available on GitHub (e.g., The Algorithms repository).



Suggested Technical Guidelines & Freedom
Technology Choices:
Backend: Python
Frontend: React
Must be functional, not just a prototype
AI Integration: Any provider/model 
OpenAI (GPT-4o, o1), Anthropic (Claude), Azure OpenAI
Open-source models (Llama, Mistral) via Ollama
Clearly document your prompts and reasoning chains
You have the freedom to choose other technology stacks and languages.
Engineering Standards:
Clean Git history with meaningful commits
Unit tests for core logic (minimum 60% branch coverage)
README with: 
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices
Setup instructions (we should run it in <10 minutes)
API documentation (if applicable)
Docker/Docker Compose for easy deployment
Teams must provide a 'Decision Log' or 'Chain-of-Thought' export. We want to see how the AI arrived at a specific refactoring or compliance decision. Black-box prompt-and-response will be scored lower than transparent reasoning
AI Best Practices:
Show your Chain-of-Thought (how does the AI reason?)
Implement guardrails (what happens when AI fails?)
Token usage optimization (don't waste context window)
Error handling (graceful degradation when APIs are down)
